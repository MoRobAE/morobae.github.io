### Open Discussion on Robot Assistants for the Elderly
Moderated by François Michaud

This period consists of an open, lively, free-wheeling discussion on any topic on robot assistants for the elderly. The audience is free to ask questions, with the objectives to get comments, advices, points of view, etc. from the other participants on important issues regarding robot assistants for the elderly, or bring ideas to the table for collaboration opportunities.

Examples can be:

 * What is missing to get robots to be used in the field? Are the difficulties mainly clinical or technological?
 * Should seniors be involved in the design? How? Is this a techno push or an application pull situation, or both?
 * Would a shared framework for robot design and evaluation be put in place?
 * Are there international opportunities and program that we should keep an eye on?
